  <h3>Answer Explanations:</h3>
  <p>See the explanations and correct structure of sentences below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>B – The opening phrase “Having finished the assignment” is a participial phrase that modifies the subject that comes immediately after it. In B, the subject is I, and it’s clear that I finished the assignment.
A. This is a dangling modifier, because it suggests the TV finished the assignment.
C. This is a fragment, not a complete sentence — there’s no main clause.
D. Awkward and incorrect — suggests the assignment is turning on the TV.
</li>
    <li>B – The opening phrase “Walking through the park” is a participial phrase that must describe the subject of the main clause. In B, the subject is we, and it’s clear that we were walking.
A. This is a dangling modifier, because it suggests the flowers were walking.
C. This is a fragment — no complete thought or subject.
D. Awkward and illogical — flowers don’t walk.
</li>
    <li>C – The opening phrase “To improve his results” is an infinitive phrase expressing purpose. It must logically refer to the subject of the main clause. In C, the subject is he, and it makes sense: he repeated the experiment to improve his results.
A. Dangling modifier, because it suggests the experiment was improving his results on its own.
B. Still a dangling modifier — the experiment didn’t have the intention to improve the results.
D. This is a fragment, not a complete sentence.
</li>
    <li>C – The introductory clause “While reading the book” must refer logically to the subject of the main clause — the one doing the reading. In C, the subject is I, which makes perfect sense: I was reading the book when I heard the phone ring.
A.  Dangling modifier — suggests the phone was reading the book.
B.  Same dangling error as A, and awkward word order.
D.  Illogical — suggests the ringing of the phone was reading the book.
</li>
    <li>B – The phrase “After reading the instructions carefully” is a modifier — it describes who did the reading. In sentence B, the students come immediately after the modifier, so it’s clear that the students were the ones who read the instructions.
In A, C, and D, the modifier is left “dangling” because the subject immediately following it is not a person who can read (the experiment or completing the experiment).
A. The experiment didn’t read the instructions — this is a dangling modifier.
C. Dangling modifier — “completing the experiment” didn’t read the instructions, and the sentence is also awkward.
D. Dangling modifier — the “successful experiment” didn’t read the instructions.
</li>
    <li>C – The introductory clause “While driving to the office in heavy traffic” needs to logically describe the subject of the main clause — the one doing the driving. In C, the subject is I, which makes sense: I was driving and I mentally reviewed the documents.
A. Dangling modifier — it illogically implies the documents were driving.
B. Same dangling problem — suggests the mental review was driving.
D. Awkward and illogical — it suggests reviewing the documents was driving.
</li>
    <li>D – The introductory phrase “To prepare for the final presentation at the conference” must logically refer to the subject of the main clause. In D, the subject is we, which makes sense: we organized and rehearsed the slides to prepare for the presentation.
A. Dangling modifier — suggests the slides were preparing for the presentation.
B. Awkward and impersonal, and still no clear subject doing the preparing.
C. Same issue as A — suggests the slides were preparing.
</li>
    <li>C – The opening clause “While waiting for the results of the application process” must logically refer to the subject of the main clause — the one who was waiting. In C, the subject is I, which is correct: I was waiting, and I considered and compared offers.
A. Dangling modifier — makes it sound like the job offers were waiting.
B. Wordy, awkward, and the subject is unclear.
D. Illogical — suggests the comparison was waiting.
</li>
    <li>C – The introductory phrase “After working late into the night to meet the deadline” must logically refer to the subject of the main clause — the one who was working. In C, the subject is I, which makes sense: I worked late and then submitted the report.
A. Dangling modifier — it makes it sound like the report was working late.
B. Awkward, wordy, and lacks a clear subject doing the action.
D. Illogical — it suggests the manager worked late.
</li>
    <li>B – The introductory phrase “While walking through the newly renovated library” must logically describe the subject of the main clause — the ones who were walking. In B, the subject is the visitors, which makes sense: the visitors were walking and were impressed.
A. Dangling modifier — suggests the arrangement of the books was walking.
C. Incomplete sentence — it’s just a fragment, no main verb.
D. Nonsensical — it suggests the books impressed the arrangement of the visitors.
